#Requirements

###1. The tournament is organized as a single elimination tournament with third place playoff.
Not considered because it does not affect the design directly.

###2. The application has two modes: tournament manager and tournament player. You can assume that the mode is selected when the application starts, with no authentication involved.
To realize this requirement, I added to the design classes player and manager.
